Develop a console based application which can take a file name and a sequence number as command line argument
and should be able to generate sql file out of it as explained below.

Database Table : customers (id, first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth, marital_status)

Example : File Content

File Type #1 

Manmay Mohanty, M, 07/03/1983, Y
Marike Fourie, F, 30/11/2001, N


File Type #2

"MANMAY"|"MOHANTY"|"1983-03-07"|"Married"|"Male"
"MARIKE"|"FOURIE"|"2001-11-30"|"Unmarried"|"Female"

File Type #3

surname: mohanty
dob: 07 Mar 1983
married: yes
gender: male
#

#

Input : <Your Application> sample.txt 400

Output : sample.sql
insert into customers(id, first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth, marital_status) values(400, 'Manmay', 'Mohanty', 'M', '07/03/1983', true);
insert into customers(id, first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth, marital_status) values(401, 'Marike', 'Fourie', 'F', '30/11/2001', false);

Note:
Must user the sequence number from the command line argument to start generating sequence.
Must store the sql file as the same name of the input file but with .sql extension

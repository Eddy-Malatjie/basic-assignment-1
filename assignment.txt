Problem Statement :
I have a business and I have branches all over south africa. And  I receive data of new customers from the
branches/offices in different formats. And I need those customer data to be inserted into my database table 
called "customers" with columns id, first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth, marital_status. So I want
you to develop a console based tool which can be used to generate necessary sqls out of those files to insert
those data into database. I am not expecting the tool to execute the sqls into my database, rather just generate
the insert statements into a file, so that I can exeute them in my database manually using a database tool. 

Develop a console based application, which can take a file name and a sequnece number as command line argument
and should be able to generate a sql file out of it and the application should be executable from command prompt 
as below, assuming that sample_1.txt is in the current directory.
C#   -> Application.exe sample_1.txt 500
Java -> java -jar application.jar sample_1.txt 500

Input file will contain new customer data in one of the formats as described below and name of the input file should 
be in the format <xyz>_<format>.txt Example : sample_1.txt, test_2.txt, abcd_3.txt 

Below are the same data for 2 customers, but with different formats, and the expected output sqls provided. 
Expected output is same for all the 3 formats as same 2 customer data is used for all the 3 formats.

File Format : 1 (sample_1.txt)
==============================
Manmay Mohanty, M, 07/03/1983, Y
Marike Fourie, F, 30/11/2001, N


File Format : 2 (sample_2.txt)
==============================
"MANMAY"|"MOHANTY"|"1983-03-07"|"Married"|"Male"
"MARIKE"|"FOURIE"|"2001-11-30"|"Unmarried"|"Female"

File Format : 3 (sample_3.txt)
==============================
#
name: manmay
surname: mohanty
dob: 07 Mar 1983
married: yes
gender: male
#
name: marike
surname: fourie
dob: 30 Nov 2001
married: no
gender: female
#

Input : <file_name>.txt 400

Output : <file_name>.sql
insert into customers(id, first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth, marital_status) values(400, 'Manmay', 'Mohanty', 'M', '07/03/1983', true);
insert into customers(id, first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth, marital_status) values(401, 'Marike', 'Fourie', 'F', '30/11/2001', false);

Note:
Following rules must be followed to generate sql file :
   - Generated sql file should be named same as the input file name, but with .sql extension (sample_1.txt -> sample_1.sql)
   - Column "id" value should be start with the number provided as command line argument and should keep incrementing
   - Column "first_name" & "last_name" should be capitalized 
     (First Letter is in CAPITAL letter and rest of the characters should be in smallcase, 
     irrespective of the format in the input file)
   - Column "gender" value should be either M or F -> M for Male , F for Female
   - Column "marital_status" value should be either true or false -> true if Married and false if Not Married
   - Column "date_of_birth" value should be in the format dd/MM/yyyy (like 30/03/2018)
